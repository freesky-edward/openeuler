### Problem description

Currently, User and other deveplors don't have way to know the CVEs that are existing or resolved in openEuler community. other more the securtiy group memebers also do not have the method to report and trace the CVE bug state.

As it may be a big system which will relate to gitee, mail list(because the report way is mail-list), we'd consider to split the whole system as several stages. this spec only for the first stage. that will only provide a way to import and explore the CVEs.

#### Use Case

Users&Developers: List all the CVEs that related to this community. Search CVEs by condition.

Security Members: Import the full list of information with excel style to update all the state of CVEs.

### Proposed change

#### New a repository

Add a seperated repository to house all code of the data management. let's name it as backend, these code will manage all the CVEs' state, provide the API to list CVE with page navigator, provide a local tool to import the datas.

#### update website

Add a lone page to show the state of CVEs, let's name it as front system.  this page will call the backend API to get datas and show them in html style.
